           anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written
       in writing. <br><span class="therefore">Therefore I ask you</span><br> <span class="therefore1">therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.
         Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither
      the eye nor the ear and it is </span><br> <span class="therefore2">therefore like a noun, just an 
        unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, 
          anybody can know that a question is a question and so why 
          add to it the question mark when it is already there when
           the question is already there in the writing.</span> <br> <span class="therefore3">Therefore I 
    never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it
     positively revolting, and now very few do use it. </span><br><br>
     <a class="linkstyle" href="https://kzhang-design.github.io/">Exclamation marks</a> have
      the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary,
       they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing 
       and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a 
       question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing 
       is true of a <a class="linkstyle" href="https://kzhang-design.github.io/">quotation</a>. When I first began writing I found it simply
        impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points 
        and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other 
        way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way. </p>
